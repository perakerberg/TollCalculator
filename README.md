# Toll fee calculator 1.0
A calculator for vehicle toll fees.

## Background

This is the current draft of requirements:
 
* Fees will differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day 
* Rush-hour traffic will render the highest fee
* The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
* A vehicle should only be charged once an hour
* Some vehicle types are fee-free
* Weekends and holidays are fee-free
